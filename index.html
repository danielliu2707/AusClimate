                    <p>
                        Regions along the coastline and southernmost areas of Australia tend to have cooler conditions compared to the central and northernmost regions, largely due to factors like 
                        the effect of sea breezes which keeps these areas cooler. The latitude of these areas also plays a significant role as coastline and southern regions are further from the equator, resulting in
                        less direct sunlight.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The northernmost regions of Australia, including Queensland and the Northern Territory, receive the highest rainfall, cause by tropical and subtropical climates
                        and their proximity to the equator.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These areas experience wet seasons during the summer months, driven by tropical cyclones and a plethora of thunderstorms.
                        The combination of high levels of humidity and strong seasonal rainfall patterns results in significantly more precipitation.

                </div>
                <p>Australia exhibits clear seasonal rainfall patterns, with significantly higher totals during early and later months of 2023, primarily driven by extreme rainfall
                    in <span class="highlight-queensland">Queensland</span> and the <span class="highlight-territories">Northern Territory</span>.
                    These tropical regions are frequently affected by floods and cyclones which contribute to significant rainfall. While rainfall decreases in <span class="highlight-queensland">Queensland</span> and the
                    <span class="highlight-territories">Northern Territory</span> towards the middle of the year, other states generally experience higher rainfall during the middle months,
                    due to the Southern Ocean, which brings moist air masses during winter.</p>

                <p>There are clear seasonal temperature patterns in Australia, with all states following a similar trend.
                    The warmest months typically occur towards the beginning and end months, while the coolest months fall inside the middle,
                    aligning with Australia‚Äôs summer and winter.

                    However, temperature variations can be more extreme in different states. The northern parts such as 
                    <span class="highlight-queensland">Queensland</span> and the <span class="highlight-territories">Northern Territory</span>
                    experience consistently high temperatures while southern states such as

                        However, summer shows less variation in the temperature between states.
                        In January 2023, the <span class="highlight-territories">Northern Territory</span> was the highest contributor with 16.98%
                        and <span class="highlight-tas">Tasmania</span> as the lowest at 9.99%, resulting in a narrow range.

                        By contrast, winter shows greater variation in temperature contributions.
                        In August 2023, the <span class="highlight-territories">Northern Territory</span> was the highest contributor with 22.44%, while 
                        <span class="highlight-tas">Tasmania</span> only contributed 8.76%, resulting in a wider range.

                    <p>
                        This chart shows the proportional contribution of each state to Australia‚Äôs total rainfall in 2023. 
                        A notable contributor was <span class="highlight-queensland">Queensland</span>, who had the highest rainfall in January, contributing 46.90% of the national total.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As you scroll through the months, rainfall distribution becomes more even throughout Australia.
                        By August 2023, every state except the <span class="highlight-territories">Northern Territory</span> contributed to at least 9% of the total rainfall,
                        compared to just two states achieving this in March 2023. This shift indicates a more balanced distribution of rainfall across Australia during the winter months,
                        compared to the uneven distribution of rainfall across states like <span class="highlight-queensland">Queensland</span> during the summer months.

                  <p>There appears to be relatively little association between the proportion of rainfall and average temperature for Australian States. However,
                    there are distinctive clusters that can be identified in the bubbleplot, with each cluster providing additional information about the combination
                    of temperature, rainfall and humidity of a particular state.

                  <span class="highlight-queensland">Queensland</span> is the state clustered in the top right of the bubbleplot, suggesting high combinations
                    of rainfall and temperature relative to other states. Furthermore, the large orange dots suggest high humidity admist the high rainfall and temperatures,
                    particularly prevalant in summer.

                    <span class="highlight-tas">Tasmania</span> is the state clustered at the bottom left of the bubbleplot, suggesting low combinations of rainfall and

                    The <span class="highlight-territories">Northern Territory</span> is positioned near the bottom right of the bubble plot,
                    indicating low rainfall and high temperatures.
                    The varying sizes of the pink dots show that winter months have low humidity, while summer months have very high humidity, reflecting a much more volatile climate.
