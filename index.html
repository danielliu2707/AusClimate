                    <p>
                        Regions along the coastline and southernmost areas of Australia tend to have cooler conditions compared to the central and northernmost regions, largely due to factors like 
                        the effect of sea breezes which keeps these areas cooler. The latitude of these areas also plays a significant role as coastline and southern regions are further from the equator, resulting in
                        less direct sunlight and milder temperatures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The northernmost regions of Australia, including Queensland and the Northern Territory, receive the highest rainfall, primarily due to their tropical and subtropical climates
                        and their proximity to the equator. These areas experience wet seasons during the summer months, driven by tropical cyclones and a plethora of thunderstorms.
                        The combination of high levels of humidity and strong seasonal rainfall patterns results in significantly more precipitation compared to the drier, southern
                        regions of Australia.

                <p>Australia exhibits clear seasonal rainfall patterns, with significantly higher totals during the early and later months of 2023, primarily driven by extreme rainfall
                    in <span class="highlight-queensland">Queensland</span> and the <span class="highlight-territories">Northern Territory</span>.
                    These tropical regions are frequently affected by floods and cyclones which contribute to significant rainfall. While rainfall decreases in <span class="highlight-queensland">Queensland</span> and the
                    <span class="highlight-territories">Northern Territory</span> towards the middle of the year, other states generally experience higher rainfall during the middle months,
                    in part due to the effects of the Southern Ocean, which brings moist air masses during winter.</p>

                <h2><br></h2> 
                <p>There are also clear seasonal temperature patterns in Australia, with all states following a similar trend.
                    The warmest months typically occur at the beginning and end of the year, while the coolest months fall in the middle,
                    aligning with Australia‚Äôs summer and winter.

                    However, temperature variations can be more extreme in different states. The northern parts such as 
                    <span class="highlight-queensland">Queensland</span> and the <span class="highlight-territories">Northern Territory</span>
                    experience consistently high temperatures while southern states such as
                    <span class="highlight-victoria">Victoria</span> and <span class="highlight-nsw">New South Wales</span> experience greater variations in temperature throughout the year.

                    <h2>Temperature Contributions<br>By State</h2>
                    <p>Scrolling through the months of the pie chart, it is evident that the contribution to the total temperature in Australia by each state is relatively uniform,
                        with all states contributing to at least 8% of total temperature in any given month. However, it is evident that the earlier months which coincide with summer exhibit
                        less variation between the temperatures of the states with the highest contributor to temperature in January of 2023 being the Northern Territory with 27.51% and
                        the lowest contributor being Tasmania with 16.19%. 

                        However, the middle months which coincide with winter exhibit greater temperature contribution ranges by the states as the higher contributor to temperature in August of 2023
                        being the Norther Territory with 22.65% and the lowest contributor being significantly less at 8.85%.

                    <p>
                        The donut chart effectively illustrates the proportional contribution of each state to Australia‚Äôs total rainfall in 2023. 
                        A notable contributor was <span class="highlight-queensland">Queensland</span>, who had the highest rainfall in January, contributing 46.90% of the national total.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As you scroll through the months, it becomes clear that rainfall distribution becomes more even throughout Australia.
                        By August 2023, every state except the <span class="highlight-territories">Northern Territory</span> contributed to at least 9% of the total rainfall,
                        compared to only two states achieving this in March 2023. This shift indicates a more balanced distribution of rainfall across Australia during the winter months,
                        compared to the uneven distribution of rainfall across states like <span class="highlight-queensland">Queensland</span> during summer.
